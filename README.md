# CloudProject-ColdChain
cloud project for temperature monitoring, using lambdas &amp; dynamoDb. 
The objective of this project is to monitor the temperature inside trucks that trasnport food or chemical products ensuring a better quality standard by using temperatures sensors that communicate with an arduino card that creates a gateway to a AWS cloud backend using lambdas and dynamoDB and then using the ID of the trip you can consult the temperature statistcs in a Node.js and Javascript frontend.
This project was made for my Cloud computing class and my Internet of Things class.
